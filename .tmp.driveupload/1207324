feat: Remove health checks from request processing for better performance

- Removed all health checks during prompt processing (sync and async)
- Fallback chain now handles provider failures naturally
- Health monitoring still runs in background for dashboard/alerts
- Added full LLM provider support (OpenAI, Gemini, Azure, Ollama, Mistral)
- Updated utilities with latest improvements from main branch
- Cleaned up test artifacts and temporary files

This improves performance and reliability by eliminating redundant health checks
that were causing false failures under concurrent load.
